League of Legends YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) Object Detection

- YOLO was the object detection model used 
- https://universe.roboflow.com/atrashrc-gmail-com/league-of-legends-mtuzl was the dataset used in fine-tuning the model on league of legends objects
- I created a new dataset that takes the above dataset and adds to it. The champion Akshan was added to the dataset
- The new data was created by programmatically creating new images of Akshan around the league of legends map to train and test on.
